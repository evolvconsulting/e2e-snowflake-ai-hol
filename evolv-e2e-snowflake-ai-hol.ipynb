   "source": "### 2. Create the Semantic Views (4 Business Domains)\n\nAI-powered Business Intelligence (BI) and conversational analytics hold immense promise for data-driven decision-making. However, directly applying these technologies to complex enterprise schemas often leads to inaccurate or inconsistent results, commonly referred to as \"hallucinations.\" This challenge arises because AI and BI systems may struggle to interpret raw data without a clear understanding of the organizational context and definitions.\n\nSemantic Views address these challenges by capturing and storing semantic model information directly within the database, including business-relevant concepts such as metrics (e.g., total sales), dimensions (e.g., product category), and facts.\n\nIn this lab, we will be creating 4 Semantic Views:\n\n- **Finance Semantic View**: Financial transactions, accounts, departments, vendors\n- **Sales Semantic View**: Sales data, customers, products, regions, sales reps\n- **Marketing Semantic View**: Campaign performance, channels, leads, impressions + **Revenue Attribution** (Salesforce CRM integration)\n- **HR Semantic View**: Employee data, departments, jobs, locations, attrition\n\n#### Basic Elements of a Semantic View Definition\nEvery semantic view definition requires essential elements:\n\n- **Physical model objects**: These refer to your existing tables, views, or (in future releases) SQL queries that contain the raw data.\n- **Relationships**: These define how your physical objects connect to each other (e.g., a CUSTOMER table linked to an ORDERS table).\n- **Dimensions**: These are business-friendly attributes used to group or filter your data (e.g., customer's birth year, product category).\n- **Metrics**: These are business-friendly calculations or aggregations, often representing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (e.g., total sales price, total sales quantity).\n\n#### Best practices for creating a semantic view\n- **Provide clear descriptions**:\n    - Use business terminology in all names and descriptions.\n    - Make descriptions detailed enough for non-technical users to understand.\n- **Include representative user questions**:\n    - Include questions that can help the model generator better understand your intent.\n    - Include variations of how questions might be asked.\n- **Review generated suggestions carefully**:\n    - Make sure the questions are relevant for the use case.\n    - Make sure the suggested relationships match your business understanding.\n- **Test with real questions**:\n    - After creating your semantic view, test it with actual business questions.\n    - Refine your semantic view, based on how well the model supports these questions.\n- **Iterate on developing the semantic view**:\n    - Start with a simple star schema.\n    - Start with core tables and metrics, then expand. We suggest three tables to keep things simple.\n    - Get feedback from business users, and refine your semantic view."

   "source": "#### a. Create a semantic view using Snowsight\n1. Access the wizard for creating semantic views in one of the following ways:\n    - Database object explorer:\n        1. Sign in to Snowsight.\n        2. In the navigation menu, select Catalog » Database Explorer.\n        3. Select the database and schema where you want to create the semantic view.\n        4. Select Create » Semantic View » Create with guided setup.\n\n    - Cortex Analyst:\n        1. Sign in to Snowsight.\n        2. In the navigation menu, select AI & ML » Cortex Analyst.\n        3. Select Create new » Create new Semantic View.\n        \n        ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/04.png)\n\n2. In the Getting started step in the wizard:\n\n    1. From Location to store, select the database and schema where the model should be stored: `EVOLV_E2E_SNOWFLAKE_AI_HOL.EDW`\n    2. In Name, enter a name for your semantic view: `FINANCE_SEMANTIC_VIEW`\n    3. Description, describe the data that your semantic view makes available: `Semantic view for financial analysis and reporting`\n    4. Select **Next**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/05.png)\n\n3. In the Select tables step in the wizard:\n\n    1. In the All tab, select the tables or views that contain the data that you want to use in your semantic view: `ACCOUNT_DIM`, `CUSTOMER_DIM`, `DEPARTMENT_DIM`, `FINANCE_TRANSACTIONS`, `PRODUCT_DIM`, `VENDOR_DIM`\n        - For better performance, don’t select more than ten tables.\n        - If you want see the list of tables and views that you selected, select the Selected tab.\n    2. Select **Next**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/06.png)\n\n4. In the Select columns step in the wizard:\n\n    1. Select the columns to include in the view.  For the purpose of this lab, select all the columns.\n        - To select all columns in a table or view, select the table or view.\n        - For better performance, don’t select more than 50 columns.\n    2. Select **Create and Save**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/07.png)\n\n5. The semantic view wizard completes and opens the Semantic View editor.  From here we will first focus on updating additional semantic information for the ACCOUNTS logical table:\n\n    1. Select Edit on the ACCOUNT_DIM Logical table.\n    2. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to inspect the data and populate the description and synonyms.\n    3. Rename the Logical table name to: `ACCOUNTS`\n    4. Select **Save**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/10.png)\n\n6. Continue to update the semantic information for each of the Dimensions on the ACCOUNTS logical table:\n\n    1. Under the ACCOUNTS logical table, select Dimensions to expand to show each dimension.\n    2. Select Edit on the ACCOUNT_NAME dimension.\n    3. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to inspect the data and populate the description and synonyms.\n    4. Select **Save**.\n    5. Select Edit on the ACCOUNT_TYPE dimension.\n    6. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to inspect the data and populate the description and synonyms.\n    7. Select **+ Sample Values** to inspect the data and automatically include sample values. Adding sample values is recommended for dimensions with relatively low-cardinality (about 1 - 10 distinct values) in which a value may be referenced by a user in a question. Before Cortex Analyst generates a SQL query for a question, it does a semantic similarity search between your question and the provided sample values to identify any appropriate literal values that may be needed to write your query.\n    \n    8. Select **Save**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/11.png)\n\n7. Remove the ACCOUNT_KEY fact as this column was incorrectly added as a fact within the semantic view by the wizard.\n\n    1. Under the ACCOUNTS logical table, select Facts to expand to show each fact.\n    2. Select the elipsis on the ACCOUNT_KEY fact, select **Remove fact**, and in the confirmation dialog select **Remove**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/12.png)\n\n8. Now we will focus on the FINANCE_TRANSACTIONS logical table. Update the additional semantic information for the FINANCE_TRANSACTIONS logical table:\n\n    1. Select Edit on the FINANCE_TRANSACTIONS Logical table.\n    2. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to inspect the data and populate the description and synonyms.\n    3. Rename the Logical table name to: `TRANSACTIONS`\n    4. Select **Save**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/13.png)\n\n9. Review the Time Dimensions APPROVAL_DATE and DATE.  These are automatically categorized as Time Dimensions because of the underlying DATE data type (TIMESTAMP data types are also categorized as Time Dimensions). Cortex Analyst can handle time-based queries on Time Dimensions, Example:\n    - \"How many transactions occured in September 2025?\"\n    - \"What was the total transaction amount in Q3?\"\n\n10. Update the Facts for the TRANSACTIONS logical table.  A Fact is a raw numeric field that can be aggregated.\n\n    1. Expand the Facts section under the TRANSACTIONS logical table and remove all the facts except AMOUNT using the same steps used above in step 7.  These are created automatically based on having a numeric data type but should be removed as we will not be aggregating by these.\n    2. Select Edit on the ACCOUNT fact.\n    3. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to populate the description and synonyms.\n    4. Select **Save**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/14.png)\n\n11. Add Metrics for the TRANSACTIONS logical table.  A Metric is an aggregate calculation defined once for consistency.\n\n    1. Add a new Metric by selecting the plus icon to the right of the Metrics header and enter the following values:\n        - Expression: `SUM(AMOUNT)`\n        - Metric name: `TOTAL_AMOUNT`\n    2. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to populate the Metric description and synonyms.\n    3. Select **Add**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/15.png)\n\n    4. Add a second Metric by again selecting the plus icon to the right of the Metrics header and enter the following values:\n        - Expression: `AVG(AMOUNT)`\n        - Metric name: `AVERAGE_AMOUNT`\n    5. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to populate the Metric description and synonyms.\n    6. Select **Add**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/16.png)\n\n    7. Add a third Metric by again selecting the plus icon to the right of the Metrics header and enter the following values:\n        - Expression: `COUNT(TRANSACTION_ID)`\n        - Metric name: `TOTAL_TRANSACTIONS`\n    8. Select **Generate fields** to use AI to populate the Metric description and synonyms.\n    9. Select **Add**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/17.png)\n\n12. Add Relationships to define how the logical tables join. Relationships require the right column to be a primary or unique key because Cortex Analyst only generates many-to-one or one-to-one relationships. For many-to-many, consider creating a shared dimension in a view and then defining two many-to-one relationships.\n\n    1. Select the plus icon to the right of the Relationships header to add a new relationships and and enter the following values:\n        - Relationship name: `TRANSACTIONS_TO_ACCOUNTS`\n        - Left table: `TRANSACTIONS`\n        - Right table: `ACCOUNTS`\n        - Left column(s): `ACCOUNT_KEY`\n        - Right column(s): `ACCOUNT_KEY`\n\n        Note: There is only a single option to select from in the Right column list as this is the single column defined as the Primary Key for the ACCOUNTS table. The primary key was inferred automatically when we added the ACCOUNTS table earlier. If the primary key does not show in the select list, you will need to return to edit the table information and specifcy the Primary key column.\n\n    2. Select **Add**.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/18.png)\n\n13. Test your Semantic View in the Cortex Analyst Playground.\n\n    1. If the chat pane is not already displayed, select **Open chat**.\n    2. Navigate to the Playground tab.\n    3. Enter `What is the total COGS by quarter since 2024?` as a test prompt and select **Run**.\n    4. Most likely Cortex Analyst was unable to answer this question.  Let's refine our semantic view to provide more clarity on how to filter by account.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/19.png)\n\n    5. Return to the ACCOUNTS logical table andselect **Edit** on the ACCOUNT_NAME dimension.\n    6. Replace the Dimension description with: `The name of the account within the chart of accounts used for financial transactions and accounting purposes.`\n    7. Replace the Synonyms with `account`.\n    8. Select **+ Sample Values** to inspect the data and automatically include sample values.  COGS should now display as a sample value.\n    9. Select **Save**.\n    10. Return to the **Playground** and reset the chat by selected the Refresh icon in the upper right.\n    11. Rerun the earlier prompt by entering `What is the total COGS by quarter since 2024?` and select **Run**. With the refinements made to the ACCOUNT_NAME dimension, Cortex Analyst is now able to clearly interpret the question and generate the correct query.\n    12. Select **+ Verified query**. Review the generated query and if determined to be accurate, select **Save and continue** to save the query. The Cortex Analyst Verified Query Repository (VQR) can help improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of results by providing a collection of questions and corresponding SQL queries to answer them. Cortex Analyst then leverages relevant SQL queries from the repository when answering similar questions.\n\n    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolvconsulting/e2e-snowflake-ai-hol/refs/heads/main/img/20.png)\n\nWe have now demonstrated the basics of setting up a semantic view within Snowsight. To complete the semantic view, we could repeat the above steps for the remaining tables. For purposes of this lab, we will script the creation of the semantic view definitions.\n\nNote: When building your own semantic views for use with Cortex Analyst, keep in mind the following:\n- Add sample queries to the Verified Queries section.\n    - These are example queries that help Cortex Analyst understand how to use the semantic view.\n    - Add queries that represent common use cases for your data.\n    - Queries can be added directly from the Cortex Analyst Playground.\n- Add synonyms for your tables, facts, dimensions, or metrics.\n    - These are alternative terms that users might use in queries.\n    - Synonyms help Cortex Analyst correctly interpret user questions.\n- Add custom instructions.\n    - These provide additional context about how the data should be interpreted.\n    - Include business rules or constraints that should be considered."
